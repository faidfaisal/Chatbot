## Project Overview
This project involved designing and implementing a **transformer-based chatbot** trained on a combination of conversational datasets and coding datasets. The chatbot is capable of both **intent recognition** and **contextually appropriate response generation**.  

The training process included:
- Text preprocessing and vectorization  
- Transformer model training with attention mechanisms, feedforward layers, and layer normalization

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to build a natural language processing (NLP) chatbot capable of:
- Understanding user intents  
- Generating contextually relevant responses  

Key objectives:
- Explore **core NLP concepts**  
- Implement **transformer-based architectures**  
- Design chatbot logic with **80% accuracy in intent recognition**  

---

## Methodology

### Data Preparation & Preprocessing
We selected pre-existing conversational and coding datasets. Preprocessing steps included:
- Tokenization and cleaning  
- Stopword removal  
- Vectorization (TF-IDF and CountVectorizer)  

### Transformer-Based Model Training
The chatbot was trained using a transformer architecture with:
- Scaled dot-product & multi-headed attention  
- Positional encoding  
- Feedforward layers and layer normalization  
- **CrossEntropyLoss** and **Adam optimizer**  

The trained model parameters can be saved/loaded for integration.  

### Chatbot Logic
- Intent prediction via the trained transformer  
- Pre-written response mapping with random variation  
- **DialoGPT fallback** for unrecognized intents  
- Optional follow-up prompts & basic memory for improved flow  

### Optimization & Interface
- Enhanced response variety  
- Conversational memory  
- Initial steps toward a web-based user interface

## Results
- **Accuracy:** ~80% in intent recognition  
- **Responses:** Generated coherent, contextually appropriate answers  
- **Design:** Modular, allowing future improvements in memory and UI integration  

---

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with:
- NLP preprocessing  
- Transformer model training  
- Chatbot design and logic  

The chatbot prototype successfully demonstrated the ability to **process text, classify intents, and generate responses**. The codebase is documented and organized for future development and research.
